The [Brains@Play] **ESCode** project is a collection of ECMAScript libraries intended to further the Web as a **Universal Development Engine** by allowing you to create and share Web Components that naturally compose into larger applications.

## The Libraries
### [esmpile]
The [esmpile] software library allows you to compile ESM code from their text sources. This allows you to track a list of active imports.

### [esmonitor]
The [esmonitor] software library allows you to receive notification about changes to objects and their values.

### [escompose]
The [escompose] software library allows you to transform ESM into Web Components that send messages to each other using the [ECMAScript Components (ESC)](./libraries/escompose/README.md#the-specification) specification.

### [escomposer]
The [escomposer] software library allows you to convert between JS, JSON, and HTML declarations of ESC.

### [escode]
The [escode] software library is a visual programming system to visualize and edit ESC files.

## The Architecture

> **Note:** We are currently in the middle of an integration effort in the [graphscript integration branch](https://github.com/brainsatplay/graphscript/tree/integration).

[escompose] is a simple extension of [graphscript], which uses several “graph script” properties such as __listeners and __onconnected to imbue objects with special behaviors.

 In general, [escompose] simply negates a flag that limiting flow graph behaviors to simple one-by-one IO for logic trees—thereby affording a map of black boxes to be produced. Outside of this change, we are also adding a few loaaders to the graphscript.Graph constructor.

```js
import graphscript from 'graphscript'
import elementLoader from 'graphscript-element-loader'

const graph = graphscript.Graph({
    tree: {
        __element: 'h1',
        __attribures: {
            innerText: 'Hello World'
        }
    },
    limitConnections: false,
    loaders: {
        __element: elementLoader,
    }
})
```
 
By using [graphscript] at the core, we can consistently visualize and manipulate the flow behaviors of [graphscript] extension. This has been achieved by funneling all listener management (including operators) through a single EventHandler instance, as well as all non-DOM reparenting through a similar management interface to retain proper DOM + reference parity

Unlike other frameworks that use hooks—such as useEffect (React) and watchEffect (Vue)—[escompose] monitors **objects** for changes to their values based on specified **listeners**, meaning we don't require explicitly registering references or using returned objects.

## Additional Repository Information
### [components](./components/README.md)
This is intended to be an official repository of ES Components.

In the near future, we will switch to the registration of ES Components through NPM via standardized use of the `graphscript` and `escomponent` keywords. These existing components will be published and distributed into independent repositories.

To learn more about the publication workflow, see the [escomponent](https://github.com/brainsatplay/escomponent) template repository.
