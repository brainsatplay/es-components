## ECMAScript Plugins (ES Plugins)

**ES Plugins** is a standard for transforming ES Modules into standardized Web Components to simplify the process of authoring composable web applications.

This library uses [graphscript](https://github.com/brainsatplay/graphscript) to compose pluginsâ€”as well as its `DOMService` class to transform plugins into Web Components.

## Benefits
- Faster prototyping and production-grade development
    - Visualization and editing of web applications at runtime
- Contribution to an Open ecosystem

## The Specification
Each Plugin contains one `default` export and any number of `named` exports.

``` javascript
export let nExecutions = 0

export default function(){
    this.nExecutions++
    return this.nExecutions
}
```

As such, this specification treats **namespace imports** (which access default *and* named exports) as first-class citizens.

### Default Exports
The `default` export defines the behavior of the Plugin.

### Named Exports
 `named` exports define the states of the Plugin. 

### Stateless vs Stateful Plugins
If the `default` export uses a **standard function** (as opposed to an arrow function), the Plugin can be assumed to be **stateful** and will modify its unique state.

On the other hand, **arrow functions** used for `default` exports imply that the Plugin is **stateless**.
