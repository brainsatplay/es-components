A set of Phaser (v3) plugins for the Brains@Play framework

To get started with your game, I'd recommend grabbing free assets from [Kenney](https://www.kenney.nl/).

This plugin was created with the support of Chris Crawford at the University of Alabama's [Human Technology Interaction Lab](https://htilua.org/).
